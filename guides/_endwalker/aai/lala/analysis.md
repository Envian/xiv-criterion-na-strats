# Mechanics

{: .casts }
*[cast]Analysis*
: Applies a random *![unseen]Unseen* debuff to each player.

*[cast]Arcane Array*
: Spawns both of the white orbs, and arrow tiles around the arena.

*[cast]Angular Addition*
: Gives both **[boss]Lala** and all players either *![three]Times Three* or
  *![five]Times Five*.

*[cast]Arcane Blight*
: Cleaves the arena with a 90Â° safe spot. This will be affected by the boss's
  *![three]Times Three* or *![five]Times Five* buffs.

*[cast]Targeted Light*
: Hits every player with a high damage attack, which can be prevented by facing
  your "gap" towards **[boss]Lala**.

-----

This mechanic is entirely personal responsibility. In order to successfully
resolve, you must use your "gap" to block various effects, in this order.

1. The first white orb will explode, and needs to be blocked by your gap.
2. *[cast]Arcane Blight* resolves. Simply stand in the safe spot.
3. The second white orb will explode. This is always in the opposite corner from
   the first.
4. You must resolve both your rotation with your *![three]Times Three* or
   *![five]Times Five* debuff, and end with your "gap" facing **[boss]Lala**.
   You do not have an opportunity to adjust between your rotation resolving, and
   *[cast]targeted light*'s effect.

While all of this is going on, the blue squares from *[cast]Arcane Array* will
be marching around the arena. These squares are what trigger the white orbs to
explode. By the end of the mechanic, only one column or row will be safe.

> The blue squares will continue marching along the sides. **[boss]Lala** will

> Quickly face your "gap" towards the final white orb.

> You will get a rotation debuff and must resolve your rotation, plus your
