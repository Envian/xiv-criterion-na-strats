# Mechanics

{: .casts }
{: .or } *[cast]Hydrobullet*
: Applies *![bullet]Hydrobullet* to all players. It is followed immidiately by
  an untelegraphed *![fall]Hydrofall*. Spread resolves first.

  be placed in bubbles as well.

## Resolve Stack/Spread

The Stacks and Spreads both resolve before any other mechanic becomes important.

## *![fall]Stack* first

<div class="mechanics" markdown="block">
> Start on your assigned half of the arena. Stand at max melee for the stack,
> and use knockback immune.

> After the stack resolves, move to your quadrant for the spread.

> **Melee** players can stand at max melee distance.
>
> **Ranged** players *must* step back towards the east/west wall.

## Resolve Towers and Crystals

Bubbles will spawn on both sides of the arena, some of which will pick up
crystals. Walking into one of these bubbles - even one with a crystal - will
result in you being picked up by the bubble, and will be blown by
*[cast]Fluke Typhoon* when it resolves.

How you solve this mechanic depends on which side of the arena you are on, and
where the "Corner crystal" is.

<div class="mechanics" markdown="block">
> Find the "Corner Crystal". This is the crystal in the center of a corner
> square. It is further away from the other crystals, and will not be picked up
> by a bubble.
>
> In this example, the "Corner Crystal" is the North East one.

![](./towers-1.png)

> The *[dps]Ranged* or *[healer]Healer* on the crystal side will need to walk
> into a bubble infront of the "Corner Crystal" in order to cross to the other
> side.
>
> All other players should stand near (but not in) their tower, and avoid the
> bubbles.
>
> **Melee** players will take the tower in the middle.
>
> **Ranged** players take the tower opposite of the "Corner Crystal"

![](./towers-2.png)

> After all bubbles are blown, every crystal will explode with a medium sized
> circle AOE. The crossing player will end up directly in their tower.

![](./towers-3.png)

> All players should move into their towers after the crystal AOEs resolve.
