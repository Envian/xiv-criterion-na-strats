# Fighting Spirits

# Mechanics

When *[cast]Fighting Spirits* begins, each player will receive a marker above
their head, with 1 to 4 dots. This represents the order that **[boss]Gorai**
will jump on players later.

When *[cast]Fighting Spirits* resolves, each player will be knocked back from
**[boss]Gorai** (This can be resisted). Shortly after **[boss]Gorai** will
become untargetable and begin jumping on players.

For each jump, **[boss]Gorai** will turn to face the next target, and performing
a very large cross AOE on the target. This cross will be oriented based on the
direction that **[boss]Gorai** jumped. This AOE applies a vulnerability on
anyone hit, killing them if they are hit by two jumps.

# Strategy

Arena with Markers
{% endfigcap %}

Each player will stand on the number marker which matches the icon above their
head. The 1, 2, and 3 players can move to their markers as soon as the knockback
resolves, however the 4 player must wait on the D marker for 2 jumps before
moving onto 4.

After being jumped on, each player must move to the letter marker which matches
their number marker's color (Except 3, who moves to the 1 marker). The timing
for this is a bit tight. Move as soon as **[boss]Gorai** leaves the ground.

If you are not skipping Malformed Reincarnation, you will need to save
*![sprint]Sprint* for that mechanic.
