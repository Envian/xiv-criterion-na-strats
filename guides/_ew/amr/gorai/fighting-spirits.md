# Fighting Spirits

# Mechanics

When *[cast]Fighting Spirits* begins casting, each player will receive a marker
above their head, with 1 to 4 dots. This represents the order that
**[boss]Gorai** will jump on players later.

When *[cast]Fighting Spirits* resolves, each player will be knocked back (This
can be knockback immuned). Shortly after **[boss]Gorai** will become
untargetable and begin jumping on players. After the 4th player, he will jump
back to the middle for one final hit.

For each jump, **[boss]Gorai** will turn to face their target and center a cross
AOE on them. this AOE is quite large, and applies a vulnerability to anyone hit
by it. Getting hit by an extra jump will kill you.

After being jumped on, no matter where the next jump is, the line AOEs for the
following jump will be centered directly on you. You must move out of the way
before the next jump.

# Strategy

{% figcap markers.png %}
Arena with Markers
{% endfigcap %}

Each player will be assigned to their number markers. Players with 1, 2, or 3
can go immidiately to their assigned spots, but 4 must wait by D until after 2
jumps.

For each player, after they are jumped on, they must move to a safe spot along
the middle of the wall.
