# Impure Purgation

# Mechanics

*[cast]Impure Purgation* will have a cone AOE target each player. Shortly
afterwards, the boss will repeat the same cone AOEs in the same location as
before.

The first AOE is unavoidable, however if a player is hit by two AOEs, then they
will be killed by a magic vulnerability.

# Strategy

There are no strictly assigned spots for this mechanic - Pay attention to where
everyone is and stay spread out. Remember to dodge the cones after the first
set goes out.
