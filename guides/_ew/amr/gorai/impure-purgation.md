# Impure Purgation

# Mechanics

*[cast]Impure Purgation* is a cone AOE on each player. Shortly afterwards, a
second set of cones will hit the same area as the first.

While the first cone AOE cannot be avoided, it applies a magic vulnerability
which will kill you if you do not dodge the followup cone.

# Strategy

There are no strictly assigned spots for this mechanic - Pay attention to where
everyone is and stay spread out. Remember to dodge the cones after the first
set goes out.

<div class="strats-grid" markdown="1">
> Stay loosely spread for the first set of cone AOEs.
