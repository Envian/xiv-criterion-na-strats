# Noble Pursuit

# Mechanics

*[boss]Shishio* will jump to the north wall, and cast *[cast]Noble Pursuit*.
During this cast, Rings will spawn around the arena. After the cast,
*[boss]Shishio* will dash through the rings, hitting anyone in the way, and
detonating the rings, which explode in line AOEs perpendicular to the dash.

The first dash is always directly south. The second dash is always to the east
or west corner. The third dash can be either diagonally across to the opposite
corner, or directly north along the east/west wall. The final dash will be the
other dash that the third could have been.

# Strategy

In all patterns, there are four safe spots near the middle of each quadrant of
the arena. Which spot is safe depends on the 2nd and diagonal dashes.

The safe spot is always on the opposite side from the 2nd dash. The safe spot is
the marker which isn't in line with the diagonal dash.
