# Noble Pursuit

# Mechanics

Shishio will dash to the north end of the arena before this cast begins.

*[cast]Noble Pursuit*
: Rings will appear around the arena, signaling a path that *[boss]Shishio* will
  dash around the arena. The dash itself is a wide AOE, and the rings will do
  thin line AOEs perpendicular to the path.
: When the cast finishes, *[boss]Shishio* will begin to dash across the arena.

While the AOEs go off in a sequence, there is a guaranteed safe spot for each
quadrant. If you are using the reccomended markers, this will be one of the
letter markers.

> In this example, either the A or D marker will be unsafe, as the B and C
> markers will both be hit by the 2nd dash.

> If the safe spot is not clear from the 3rd line, then the 4th will make it
