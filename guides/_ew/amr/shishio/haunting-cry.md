# Haunting Cry

# Cheat Sheet

* Pull tether through the middle, avoid ghosts, and wait for markers.
* *Marked Players* take defamations to corners away from towers.
* *Unmarked Players* take towers.

This mechanic is very random, so pay attention to your team and adjust
accordingly.

# Mechanics

*[cast]Haunting Cry* Spawns a ghost for each player. Each ghost will tether to
one player, slowly approaching them and frequently performing circular AOEs.

*[boss]Shishio* will then begin casting *[cast]Vengeful Souls*. This will spawn
two towers and apply markers to two players. The marked players will explode
with a massive AOE at the end of this cast. At the same time, both of the towers
will resolve.

This is followed with *[cast]Thunder Vortex*, which is a large donut AOE.

# Strategy

Everything about this mechanic is completely random. Ghosts can spawn anywhere
in the arena, towers can spawn on any cardinal or intercardinal, and the players
marked are random as well.

There are no fixed priorities, but there are some strategies which help.
