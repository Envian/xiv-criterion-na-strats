# Haunting Cry

# Mechanics

*[cast]Haunting Cry*
: Spawns a ghost for each player. Each ghost will tether to one player, slowly
  approaching them and periodically performing circular AOEs.

*[cast]Vengeful Souls*
: When the cast starts, two towers will spawn at two random locations. Two
  players will also receive marker above their head.
: When the cast finishes, both towers are snapshotted, and both players with a
  marker will explode with a fairly large AOE.

*[cast]Thunder Vortex*
: This is a large donut AOE, similar to the donut from Unnatrual Wail 2.

Both the defamation markers and towers will apply a magic vulnerability, so the
marked players cannot take towers.

# Strategy

Everything about this mechanic is completely random. Ghosts can spawn anywhere
in the arena, towers have 8 possible locations they can spawn (Cardinals and
intercardinals), and the players marked are random as well.

Because of this randommess, there are no set strategies or priorities, but there
are some guidelines which will help.

>
> Tower players begin identifying which tower you'll take, using body language

> Keep adjusting your positioning as the ghosts approach, moving towards your
> final safe spot as the cast gets closer to finishing.

> The last ghost AOE comes out when the castbar for *[cast]Vengeful Souls*
> crosses the `o` in Souls. After this, the ghosts despawn and players have a
> moment to move before *[cast]Vengeful Souls* finsihes.
