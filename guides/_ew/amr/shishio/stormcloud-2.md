# Stormcloud Summons 2

# Mechanics

This is very similar to Stormcloud Summons 1. Begins with
*[cast]Stormcloud Summons*, turning the arena circular and spawning clouds
evenly around the arena border.

*[boss]Shisho* will then cast *[cast]Smokeater*, sucking up clouds one, two, or
three times. The first iteration will always be one suck. The second iteration
will suck two or three times.

*[cast]Lightning Bolt* kicks off the mechanic. Each of the remaining clouds will
begin casting line AOEs, randomly targeting other players or clouds. These line
AOEs will be larger for each suck from earlier, however there will be fewer line
AOEs overall.

{: .info }
The second iteration of this mechanic is often skipped, even in Savage.

# Strategy

There is very little strategy that can help with this mechanic. For the first
iteration with only one suck, I suggest staying spread as much as possible, and
avoid the middle. Ranged players can also stand near one of the missing clouds,
reducing the chance they get in the path of a line targeting a cloud.
