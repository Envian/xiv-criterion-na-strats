# Stormcloud Summons 1

# Mechanics

*[cast]Stormcloud Summons*
: Turns the arena into a circle, and spawns clouds along the edge.

*[cast]Smokeater*
: *[boss]Shishio* will absorb one set of clouds. The first iteration of this
  mechanic will always absorb only one set of clouds, and the second set will
  absorb two or three.

*[cast]Lightning Bolt*
: A small, telegraphed circle AOE will occur around each remaining cloud.

Next, each cloud will begin casting *[cast]Cloud to Cloud*. These casts will be
rapid and thin for the first iteration, getting larger and less frequent for
each additional set of absorbed clouds.

There is very little strategy that can help with this mechanic. For the first
iteration with only one absorb, I suggest staying spread, and ranged players can
try to stay near a gap in the clouds to reduce the chance they're targeted by a
*[cast]cloud to cloud* targeting another cloud.
