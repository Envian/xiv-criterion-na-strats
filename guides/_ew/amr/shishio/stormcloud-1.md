# Stormcloud Summons 1

# Mechanics

*[cast]Stormcloud Summons*
: Turns the arena into a circle, and spawns clouds around the arena.

*[cast]Smokeater*
: *[boss]Shishio will "suck" some of the clouds around the arena between one and
  three times. The more sucks, the fewer clouds remain, but the larger their
  explosions will be.

*[cast]Rokujo Revel*
: Telegraphs up to line AOEs in an order, one for each suck.

When a cloud is hit by either a line AOE, or the AOE from another cloud, it will
explode, often resulting in a chain of explosions.

# Strategy

{: .text-center }
## One Suck

<div class="mechanics" markdown="1">
> Solve this mechanic relative to the telegraphed line AOE.
>
> There are 6 possible cloud locations within the red line AOE, two of which
> will be removed. Both of the spots with a missing cloud show where the safe
> dodges will be.

![](./1-suck-1.png)

> Start by standing next to the line AOE, where one of the clouds is missing.
> As soon as the line AOE resolves, move in, a bit past the middle of the arena.

## Two Sucks

<div class="mechanics" markdown="1">
> This pattern is solved relative to the first line AOE to appear.
>
> On one side of this line, there will be 1 cloud. On the other, there will be
> two clouds.

![](./2-suck-1.png)

> Start by standing next to the first line, on the same side as the solo cloud,
> but across from it. This will be the larger wedge, which has two clouds in it.
>
> Once the first line AOE resolves, move towards the first cloud, which will be
> safe.

{: .text-center }
## Three Sucks

<div class="mechanics" markdown="1">
> This pattern is solved relative to the first line AOE to appear.
>
> There will be a single cloud in the first line AOE. The starting area is about
> 90Â° away from the singular cloud, on the side of the line opposite of the
> cloud.

![](./3-suck-1.png)

> Start by standing inside the corner of the 3rd line AOE. Once the first cloud
> detonates, move towards it until you're clear of the 3rd line.
