# Details

{% figure ./adds.png %}

This room contains 3 packs of enemies which must be killed.

* A Shishu Raiko + two Shishu Furutsubaki
* A Shishu Fuko + two Red Shishu Penghou
* A Shishu Yuki

While the Raiko and Fuko are still alive, the Yuki will have a massive damage
buff and cannot be hurt. To add to the complexity, the Yuki will also patrol
around the room in a figure 8 pattern, and periodically cleave half of the room.
This cleave is telegraphed in Normal, but not in Savage.

Yuki Patrol. Continues CCW after returning North.
{% endfigcap %}

During the fights before the Yuki, be sure not to hit it with any AOEs, and be
careful if you have auto target enabled. It has sight based aggro, so keep your
distance while it approaches, but once it turns it becomes safer.

While the Raiko and Fuko can be killed in any order, the Yuki's patrol makes
killing the Raiko first much easier.

## Shishu Raiko

{% figure ./raiko.png %}

This add is paired with two Shishu Furutsubaki, which will periodically perform
frontal cone AOEs throughout the fight. The Raiko will loop through a few simple
mechanics.

***[cast]Disciples of Levin*** --- A circular AOE centered on the Raiko, which
is slightly larger than max melee.

***[cast]Barreling Smash*** --- Marks a non-tank. Performs a charge towards that
player, setting their and anyone hit's HP to 1. The player who gets marked
should move away from the group.

***[cast]Howl*** --- A raidwide which does a small amount of damage.

***[cast]Master of Levin*** --- A donut AOE where the safe spot is roughly the
Raiko's targeting circle.

Begin by pulling this add pack to the south east corner. The Yuki will patrol
south from its starting spot and turn towards the south west corner. After the
*[cast]Howl* cast, pull everything across to the south west. The Yuki will have
passed by this point.

## Shishu Fuko

{% figure ./fuko.png %}

This add is paired with two Red Shishu Penghou, which will periodically target
random players with a moderately sized circular AOE. The Fuko will loop through
a few simple mechanics.

***[cast]Scythe Tail*** --- A circular AOE centered on the Fuko, which is
slightly larger than max melee.

***[cast]Twister*** --- A stack marker targeted on a random player.

***[cast]Crosswind*** --- A heavy raidwide and knockback from the Fuko.

Begin by pulling this pack against the west wall. Don't pull it into the corner
yet, wait until *[cast]Scythe Tail*, otherwise you may not have room with the
Yuki approaching.

During this fight, usually soon after the *[cast]Scythe Tail*, the Yuki will
make its way north up the entrance of the arena. Once there, it will cast
*[cast]Left Swipe* or *[cast]Right Swipe* - you may need to dodge this by
crossing to the other side of the arena. In normal, this AOE is telegraphed
early, however in Savage you will need to check the cast, or look at the Yuki's
hand.

After the Yuki's swipe, pull the Fuko to the east wall to give yourself more
time before the Yuki patrols back to you.

## Shishu Yuki

Casts *[cast]Left Swipe* or *[cast]Right Swipe* periodically, and hits very
hard. Tank should use any remaining mitigation on the autos between casts.
