# Trash Pack 2

{% include_relative trash2/markers.md %}

During this room, you will need to dodge line AOEs from the wind elementals
while fighting each enemy. While these AOEs seem random and chaotic, there is
actually a fixed pattern, which means there are a few safe spots that can be
used.

The markers above show the preferred safe spots for each enemy.

## Shishu Kotengu

Pull the first one to the 1 marker - This spot will be safe during the entire
fight.

Begins by casting one of 3 "blows" attacks, turning to face a random player when
the cast starts.

*[cast]Backward Blows*
: A cone AOE which hits the front of the Kotengu, followed by the back.

*[cast]Leftward Blows*
: A cone AOE which hits the front of the Kotengu, followed by its left.

*[cast]Rightward Blows*
: A cone AOE which hits the front of the Kotengu, followed by its right.

Afterwards, two more casts:

*[cast]Wrath of the Tengu*
: A painful raidwide which applies a bleed.

*[cast]Gaze of the Tengu*
: A simple look away mechanic.

## Shishu Onmitsugashira

{% figcap./2-safe-indicator.png %}
The 2 marker is safe after this AOE resolves.
{% endfigcap %}

The 2 marker will likely not be safe yet when you first are ready to pull this
add. It will become safe once the wind sprite in the north west corner hits the
2 marker with a line AOE.

The Onmitsugashira will cast the following spells in order:

*[cast]Juji Shuriken*
: Turns to face a random player, and casts a thin line AOE towards them.

*[cast]Issen*
: A hard hitting tankbuster, which does not cleave.

*[cast]Huton*
: Speeds up the cast time of *[cast]Juji Shuriken*, and begins to rapidly cast
  it.

## Shishu Kotengu 2

The 3 marker is not safe until it is hit by the wind sprite on the west wall.
This Kotengu is identical to the first one.
