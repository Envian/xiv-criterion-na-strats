# Details

During this room, you will need to dodge line AOEs from the wind elementals
while fighting each enemy. While these AOEs seem random and chaotic, it actually
follows a fixed pattern.

The markers above show 3 distinct safe areas, which will be safe from wind
elementals while fighting the adds in this room.

## Shishu Kotengu

Pull the first one to the 1 marker - This spot will be safe during the entire
fight.

* ***[cast]Left/Right/Backward Blows*** --- Turns to face a random player. Does
  a 90Â° frontal cone AOE, followed by an AOE on the side from the cast.
* ***[cast]Wrath of the Tengu*** --- A powerful raidwide with a bleed.
* ***[cast]Gaze of the Tengu*** --- A simple look away mechanic.

Be careful moving towards 2. Keep an eye on the wind sprites as they will
periodically cleave the arena.

## Shishu Onmitsugashira

{% figcap ./2-safe.png %}
The 2 marker is safe after this AOE resolves.
{% endfigcap %}

The 2 marker will likely not be safe yet when you first are ready to pull this
add. It will become safe once the wind sprite in the north west corner hits the
2 marker with a line AOE.

* ***[cast]Juji Shuriken*** --- Turns to face a random player, and casts a thin
  line AOE them.
* ***[cast]Issen*** A hard hitting tankbuster, which does not cleave.
* ***[cast]Huton*** Speeds up the cast time of *[cast]Juji Shuriken*.

The Onmitsugashira will then rapidly and repeatedly cast *[cast]Juji Shuriken*
until killed.

## Shishu Kotengu 2

{% figcap ./3-safe.png %}
The 3 marker is safe after this AOE resolves.
{% endfigcap %}

The 3 marker is not safe until it is hit by the wind sprite on the west wall.
This Kotengu is identical to the first one.
