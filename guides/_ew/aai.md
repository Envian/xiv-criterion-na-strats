# Another Aloalo Island

**ilvl**
: 665

**BIS**
: Same bis as Anabaseos w/ Manderville relic weapons.

The DPS check is very lenient, so synced down DT gear is more than enough.

{: .warning }
Dawntrail ilvl 663 dungeon will be synced despite being under the ilvl cap.
Use either level 90 melded gear, or level 95+ synced gear.

![](./rewards/trisassant.png)

Aloalo Coins and Aloalo Manuscripts can be exchanged for rewards in Old
Sharlayan (12.0, 13.3), near the docks.

### Criterion (Regular)

Each clear gives you 4x Aloalo Coins (Can be checked in the V&C Dungeon Finder
menu), with a small chance of the Quaqua Horn (Mount) to drop as personal loot.

There are 3 unique rewards which can be purchased with Aloalo coins:

* [8x] Aloalo Island Framer's Kit
* [8x] O Hunter, Rejoice Orchestration Roll (Tradable, Criterion OST)
* [100x] Quaqua Horn (Tradeable)

### Criterion (Savage)

Each clear of Criterion (Savage) rewards you with 1x Aloalo Manuscript, which
can be traded for one of two unique items:

* Forgotten Figure (Furniture Item)
* Elevated Ester (Weapon upgrade Item)

{: .floating-image .float-right .box-shading .pb-0 }
![](./rewards/khaldeen.png)

Elevated Ester can be used to upgrade the 660 tome weapons from Anabaseios into
665 weapons, with a glow. The tome weapons can be bought from the tome vendor in
Old Sharlayan, and traded for the upgraded weapons in Radz-at-han (10.9, 10.4).

*Note: You must have unlocked Criterion (Savage) to see the Elevated Ester
Augmentation menu.*
