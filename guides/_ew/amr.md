# Another Mount Rokkon

**ilvl**
: 665

**BIS**
: Same BIS as Anabaseos w/ Manderville relic weapons.

The DPS check is very lenient, so synced down DT gear is more than enough.

{: .warning }
Dawntrail ilvl 663 dungeon will be synced despite being under the ilvl cap.
Use either level 90 melded gear, or level 95+ synced gear.

Shishu Coins and Rokkon Manuscripts can be exchanged for rewards in Old
Sharlayan (12.0, 13.3), near the docks.

### Criterion (Regular)

Each clear gives you 4x Shishu Coins (Can be checked in the V&C Dungeon Finder
menu), with a small chance of the Shishioji Flute (Mount) to drop as personal
loot.

There are 3 unique rewards which can be purchased with Shishu coins:

* [8x] Mount Rokkon Framer's Kit
* [8x] Crimson Rise Orchestrion Roll (Tradable, Criterion OST)
* [100x] Shishioji Flute (Tradeable)

### Criterion (Savage)

Oyoroi Display
{% endfigcap %}

Each clear of Criterion (Savage) rewards you with 1x Rokkon Manuscript, which
can be traded for Endwalker materia, or an Oyoroi Display. While the Oyoroi
Display is not a tradeable item, it can be placed in an FC house, and picked
up by someone else.
