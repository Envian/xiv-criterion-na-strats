![fall]

> **Hydrofall Target**
>
> *Designated target of Hydrofall, which will activate when this effect
> expires.*
>
> This is a simple 2 person stack. It is a bit smaller than an arena square -
> If you are in the center, it will not quite reach the corners. This
> debuff is always role based - both *[support]Support* or both *[dps]DPS*,
> unless a player is dead when *[cast]Hydrofall* resolves.
