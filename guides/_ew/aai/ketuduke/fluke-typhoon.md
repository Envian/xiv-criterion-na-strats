# Mechanics

## Stack and Spread

Begins with *[cast]Hydrobullet* or *[cast]Hydrofall*. This will apply either
*![bullet]Hydrobullet* to all players, or *![fall]Hydrofall* to one role.
Shortly after the cast, the other debuff is applied with a longer timer.

*[cast]Angry Seas* is a short line knocback away from center, with a fairly
large section of the middle unsafe. This will split the arena vertically. The
first *[cast]Hydrobullet* or *[cast]Hydrofall* will resolve immidiately after
the knockback. you do not have time to adjust.

For the rest of the mechanic, the unsafe area from *[cast]Angry Seas* will be a
deathwall. The 2nd *[cast]Hydrobullet* or *[cast]Hydrofall* will resolve shortly.

## Towers

{: .float-right .floating-image .mb-8 }
> ![](./arena.png)
>
> {: .text-center }
> Arena with towers and crystals.

*[cast]Spring Crystals* will then Spawns 4 circular crystals on one side of the
arena. These explode in a relatively small circular AOE at the end of the mechanic.

*[cast]Bubble Net* is the same raidwide from before. Spawns several bubbles
around the arena, 3 towers on the side without crystals, and 1 on the side with.
Some of the crystals will be placed in bubbles.

Any player who touches a bubble will be picked up by the bubble. When
*[cast]Fluke Typhoon* resolves, they will be pushed, and end up either on the
other side, or in the death wall.

## Timeline

1. Resolve *[cast]Angry Seas* KB + first Stack or Spread.
2. Resolve 2nd Stack or Spread.
3. Raidwide + bubbles appear.
4. Bubbles pushed, crystals explode.
5. Towers resolve.

# Strategy

We will be starting with two players on each side of the *[cast]Angry Seas*
split. The pair will solve their stack and spread on their side, and afterwards
we'll have the **Ranged** player on the 1 tower side cross over to the other
side.

## Stack and Spread

{: .info }
There is a lot of damage going out between *[cast]Angry Seas* and
*[cast]Bubble Net*, all while players are spreading. Those two casts resolve
~13s apart, so it is reccomended to use any mitigation which can cover both.

## Towers

For **melee** players, you are assigned to the middle tower on your side of the
arena. **Ranged** players will flex to the other two towers.

<div class="mechanics" markdown="1">
> Find the "Corner Crystal". This is the crystal in the center of a corner
> square. It is further away from the other crystals, and will not be picked up
> by a bubble.
>
> In this example, the "Corner Crystal" is the north east one.
