# Mechanics

{: .casts }
{: .or } *[cast]Hydrobullet*
: Applies *![bullet]Hydrobullet* to all players. It is followed immidiately by
  an untelegraphed *![fall]Hydrofall*. Spread resolves first.

*[cast]Hydrofall*
: Applies *![fall]Hydrofall* to one role. It is followed immidiately by
  an untelegraphed *![bullet]Hydrobullet*. Stack resolves first.

*[cast]Angry Seas*
: Telegraphs a line knockback from center, with the center being dangerous.

*[cast]Spring Crystals*
: Spawns 4 circular crystals on one side of the arena.

*[cast]Bubble Net*
: Raidwide. Spawns several bubbles around the arena. Some of the crystals will
  be placed in bubbles as well.
: This also spawns 3 towers on the empty side, and 1 tower on the crystal side.

*[cast]Fluke Typhoon*
: When the cast resolves, an arena-wide knockback will be telegraphed, from the
  crystal side, to the empty side.

## Resolve Stack/Spread

The Stacks and Spreads both resolve before any other mechanic becomes important.

{: .info }
There is a lot of damage going out between *[cast]Angry Seas* and
*[cast]Bubble Net*, all while players are spreading. Those two casts resolve
~13s apart, so it is reccomended to use any mitigation which can cover both.

## Resolve Towers and Crystals

Crystals will spawn on one side of the arena. Afterwards, bubbles will spawn
on both sides of the arena. Walking into one of these bubbles - *even one with a
crystal* - will result in you being picked up by the bubble.

Finally, 3 towers will spawn on the empty side of the arena, and one on the
crystal side.

One player will need to ride a bubble from the crystal side over to the empty
side. If any other player touches a bubble, they will not be able to resolve
the towers.

How you solve this mechanic depends on which side of the arena you are on, and
where the "Corner crystal" is.

<div class="mechanics" markdown="1">
> Find the "Corner Crystal". This is the crystal in the center of a corner
> square. It is further away from the other crystals, and will not be picked up
> by a bubble.
>
> In this example, the "Corner Crystal" is the North East one.

![](./towers-1.png)

> The *[dps]Ranged* or *[healer]Healer* on the crystal side will need to walk
> into a bubble infront of the "Corner Crystal" in order to cross to the other
> side.
>
> **Melee** players will take the tower in the middle.
>
> **Ranged** players take the tower opposite of the "Corner Crystal"
