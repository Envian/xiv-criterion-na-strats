# Mechanics

{: .casts }
*[cast]Spacial Tactics*
: Gives each player one, two, three, or four stacks of
  *![beta]Subtractive Supressor Beta*.

*[cast]Arcane Array*
: Spawns blue squares in opposite corners (Same pattern as Analysis), as well
  as a sphere, and a few orange cubes.
: The sphere will explode when activated by the blue square. There is no way to
  dodge this, and it removes a stack of *![beta]Beta*.
: The cubes will explode in in both cardinal directions when activated by the
  blue squares.
: {: .demphasize }
  The snapshot for the cubes is *significantly* earlier than the animation.

*[cast]Arcane Array*
: Gives the boss either *![three]Times Three* or *![five]Times Five*.

*[cast]Arcane Blight*
: Same 90Â° safe area AOE from earlier. This resolves after everything else.

*![beta]Subtractive Suppressor Beta* is the same as
*![alpha]Subtractive Suppressor Alpha* - If you do not clear your debuff stacks,
then you will explode and wipe the raid. A stack of *![beta]Beta* is removed
each

> Start on 2, then move to 1 after it is hit.

> *![beta]2 Stacks* needs to be hit by one orange cube.

> Plant on 2, under the boss.

> *![beta]3 Stacks* needs to be hit by two orange cubes.

> Plant on 3, in the row with two cubes.
