## Repeat Casts / Mechanics

*[cast]Angular Addition*
: Applies *![three]Times Three* and/or *![five]Times Five* to either each
  player, **[boss]Lala**, or both. This modifies the next rotational mechanic.

*[cast]Arcane Blight*
: A room wide AOE with a 90Â° safe spot on one of the cardinal positions. It is
  cast once at the start of the fight, and again during a few mechanics.
: This is always paired with *![three]Times Three* or *![five]Times Five*, plus
  a rotation telegraph above the boss.

Blue Squares
: Several mechanics have blue squares. These squares move across the arena, tile
  by tile, changing directions when they overlap an arrow. They will inflict a
  lethal bleed effect if touched.
