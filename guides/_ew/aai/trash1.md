## Tornados

After pulling the first add, tornados will spawn and move along the walls,
dealing heavy damage and knocking players back. Even though the tornados are
moving circular AOEs, there are no safe areas, so players must keep moving the
nb entire time.

Additionally, both the south west and north east corners are exactly the width
of a tornado. If you go into one of these thin areas, a tornado will come in and
kill you.

Aim to pull adds into the center of one of the larger areas. This way you can
move around the tornados.

## Kiwakin

Mechanics always occur in the same order.

* *[cast]Lead Hook* is a 3 hit tankbuster.
* *[cast]Sharp Strike* is a heavy hitting tankbuster which also applies a
  dispellable bleed.
* *[cast]Tail Screw* is a targeted circle AOE on the tank. This can be avoided.

## Snipper

Comes with two crab adds. Neither have any abilities, and simply auto attack
their target. Mechanics always occur in the same order.

* *[cast]Water III* is a standard stack marker.
* *[cast]Bubble Shower* is a small, 90° frontal cone.
* *[cast]Crab Dribble* has a very quick cast. it is a small 90° rear cone.

## Ray

Mechanics always occur in the same order.

* *[cast]Hydrocannon* is a small untelegraphed line AOE infront of the ray.
* *[cast]Expulsion* is a circular AOE centered on the Ray. It is slightly larger
  than max melee.
* *[cast]Electric Whorl* is a large donut AOE, centered on the ray.

## Monk

This enemy has dangerously painful auto attacks. Like the others, mechanics
always occur in the same order.

* *[cast]Hydroshot* puts a marker on a target, then knocks them back, doing
  moderate damage and applying a painful bleed. Knockback immune works on this.
  *[cast]Hydroshot* will be cast 3 times in a row, once on each non-tank.
* *[cast]Cross Attack* is a very hard hitting tankbuster.
