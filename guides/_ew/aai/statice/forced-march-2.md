# Mechanics

*[cast]Beguilling Glitter* will give all players a random *![march]Forced March*
 debuff, two players with a short 39s timer, and two players with a long 50s timer.

Next, **[boss]Statice** will set up a *[cast]Trick Reload*, and resolve the
first stack or spread independent of any other mechanics.

*[cast]Present Box* spawns 4 staffs which telegraph donut AOEs, followed by
*[cast]Ring a Ring O' Explosions*, spawning a series of bombs.

Short *![march]Forced March* players will be marched, and a couple seconds after
*[cast]Trigger Happy* and the donut AOEs resolve.

Finally, long marches will begin, ending with the marked bombs detonating, and
*[cast]Trapshooting*'s stack or spread.

# Strategy

The mechanics are fairly straightforward, so this mechanic serves more as a
nerves check in savage, and can likely be skipped entirely in regular.

While this mechanic is personal responsibility, players will be split into
two categories:

* *![march]Short March* with the shorter timer.
* *![march]Long March* with the longer timer.

*This does not impact the distance of the march, it only refers to the timer.*
