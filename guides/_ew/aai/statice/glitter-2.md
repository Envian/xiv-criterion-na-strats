# Mechanics

{: .casts }
*[cast]Beguilling Glitter*
: Gives all players a random *![march]Forced March* debuff, two players with a
  39s timer, and two players with a long 50s timer.

*[cast]Trick Reload*
: Sets up a trick reload.

*[cast]Trapshooting*
: Resolves the first stack/spread with no additional mechanics.

*[cast]Present Box*
: Spawns 4 staffs which telegraph donut AOEs.

*[cast]Ring a Ring O' Explosions*
: Spawns 6 bombs around the arena, tethered into two sets of 3. All patterns are
  possible here. The bombs do not detonate until the 2nd *[cast]Trapshooting*.

*[cast]Trigger Happy*
: Resolves the slice from the earlier *[cast]Trick Reload*. Short march players
  must march to the safe spot.

*[cast]Trapshooting*
: Resovles the final stack/spread from the earlier *[cast]Trick Reload*. The
  bombs also detonate at this time.

# Strategy

{: .float-right .floating-image }
![](./slices.png)

The mechanics are fairly straightforward, so this mechanic serves more as a
nerves check in savage, and can likely be skipped entirely in regular.

Begin by solving the *[cast]Trapshooting* as a standalone mechanic.

Next, *![march]Short March* will need to march into the safe slice for
*[cast]Trick Reload*. you have a couple seconds to adjust after the march ends.

*The slice numbers don't appear until right before the* *![march]Forced March*
*begins, so you will need to know where the slice is before it appears.*

Finally, resolve the *![march]Long March*, followed by the final
*[cast]Trapshooting* stack/spread. As before, you have a couple seconds to
adjust after the march, but before the bombs and *[cast]Trapshooting* resolves.

For **Spread**, *![march]Long March* players should pick a location and adjust
if necessary. *![march]Short March* players should do the same, but stay out of
the way of others.

For **Stack**, all players should aim to stack in the middle if its safe.
Otherwise, aim for the center of the largest safe area. The exact location can
change, so *![march]Long March* should aim for the pair of *![march]Short March*
players.
