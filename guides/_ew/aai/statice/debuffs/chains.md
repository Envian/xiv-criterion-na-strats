> *Red-hot chains sear the flesh on your body, causing damage over time.*
>
> These chains require you to "stretch" them a certain distance before they will
> break. In both scenarios where this chain is used, you must start stacked
> mid, and run all the way to opposite sides of the arena.
>
> This debuff is always preceeded by a "chain" animation above the player's head.
> After a couple seconds, this debuff will apply and the starting length of the
> chain will snapshot.
