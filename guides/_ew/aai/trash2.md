# Trash Pack 2

## Buffs

In this room there are two types of adds, *Wood Golems* and *Islekeepers*. When
you enter the room, *Wood Golems* have an increased DPS buff, while *Islekeepers*
will have buff which makes them functionally invulnerable. Each time you kill
one of the adds, the buffs on each add in the room will swap.

Because of these buffs, plus the fact that each add has a hard enrage, you must
alternate between killing *Wood Golems* and *Islekeepers*.

## Patrols

Both types of adds will also patrol around the arena in a figure 8 pattern.

* *Wood golems* travel north across the middle path.
* *Islekeepers* travel west across the middle path.

Both types of adds will always follow a figure 8 pattern, crossing the middle
in the same way each time.

Every time an add is killed, the remaining adds will speed up.

## Wood Golem

Mechanics always occur in the same order.

* *[cast]Ancient Areo III* is an interruptable raidwide which will wipe the group.
* *[cast]tornado* targets a player with a marker, giving them and nearby players
  a dispellable bind. Warriors can resist this with Inner Release.
* *[cast]Ovation* is a line AOE targeted on the player who received bind.

While difficult, if the bind is esuna'd fast enough, the Wood Golem will skip
*[cast]Ovation*.

## Islekeeper

Mechanics always occur in the same order.

* *[cast]Ancient Quaga* is a hard hitting raidwide paired with a DOT effect.
* *[cast]Gravity Force* is a standard stack marker.
* *[cast]Isle Drop* is an untelegraphed circle AOE, centered on a random player.
  Islekeepers will always face their target before casting, so move behind.

## Pull Order

There are several ways to safely pull these adds. This is just one example.
Follow the tank's lead.


<div class="mechanics" markdown="1">
> Begin by pulling the north west Wood Golem to the north east corner.

> Next, pull the islekeeper to the north east corner. it should be crossing or
> about to cross middle.

> Next, pull the final Wood Golem to the south east corner. It should be about
> to turn into the group.

> The final Islekeeper can be killed wherever.
