# Envian's Criterion Strategies

## **View the current version of these strats [here]({{ site.url }}).**

The website is generated via [Jekyll] using [Just-The-Docs]
as a theme.

## How to contribute

### Open an Issue

You can [open an issue]({{ site.repo }}/issues) on github.

### Create a Pull Request

Pull requests allow you to make the changes on a local copy of the site, and
send those changes directly to me. You will need a github account, and a little
bit of git knowledge.

1. [Make a fork]({{ site.repo }}/fork) of this repository.
2. Make changes to your forked copy of the site.
3. [Create a pull request]({{ site.repo }}/compare)

### Create a new Diagram

All diagrams in this site are currently made using xivplan. All the `.xivplan`
files used have been included.

### Locally testing changes

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:
1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.
2.  Run `bundle install`.
3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.
