# In Game Videos/Footage
* POVs for Rokkon
    - Trash 2 - safe spot indicator for the 3 marker.
    - Shishio - Spread for yolo ghosts.
    - Shishio - Need to fix rings pattern (Along wall is valid pattern)
    - Gorai - Need a bad pattern for Rousing Reincarnation 1\
    - Gorai - Need 4 pattern POV for jumps
    - Moko - Need POV of scarlet with tether.
    - Moko - Need uptime POV for melee.
* Need better images of the grow/split pattern for Gorai

# Research
* Are the dodges for Shishio - Stormcloud 1 2+3 suck always the same direction?
* Sormcloud 1 - 3 suck - is there a reliable melee uptime strat?

# Other TODOs
* Animations for mechanics that would benefit from it
* Better diagram for Shisho Noble Pursuit. Current rings are not very accurate.
* Need AMR Waymarks
