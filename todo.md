# In Game Videos/Footage
* POVs for Rokkon
    - Trash 2 - safe spot indicator for the 3 marker.
    - Shishio - Spread for yolo ghosts.

# Research
* Are the dodges for Shishio - Stormcloud 1 2+3 suck always the same direction?
* Sormcloud 1 - 3 suck - is there a reliable melee uptime strat?

# Other TODOs
* Animations for mechanics that would benefit from it
* Better diagram for Shisho Noble Pursuit. Current rings are not very accurate.
* Need AMR Waymarks
