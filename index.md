# Envian's Criterion NA Strats

This is a collection of guides for Criterion, using the strats I've encounted
from party finder, the Criterion discord, and my own blind static's solutions.

These strategies mostly follow what NA Party Finder uses, however there are some
differences - those will be called out and explained where appropriate.
