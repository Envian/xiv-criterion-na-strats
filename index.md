# Envian's Criterion NA Strats

This is a collection of guides for Criterion, using the strats from party
finder, the Criterion discord, and my own blind static's solutions.

The main guide exclusively uses PF strategies, however some personal
responsibility mechanics are framed or explained in a way different to other
guides. These strategies are still compatible with PF strats, and will resolve
the same way.

Some mechanics have alterntive strategies, which are incompatible with PF strats.
These are hidden by default, and clearly labeled as non-standard.
