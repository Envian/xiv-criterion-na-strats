# Envian's Criterion NA Strats

This is a collection of guides for Criterion, using the NA Pastebin strats.

The main guide exclusively uses PF strategies, however some personal
responsibility mechanics are framed or explained in a way different to other
guides. These strategies are still compatible with PF strats, and will resolve
the same way.

# Fights

{: .fs-6 }
* **[Another Mount Rokkon](./amr/)**
* **[Another Aloalo Island](./aai/)**

# How to Best Use This Guide

Each mechanic in this guide is split into 4 distinct sections:

**Cheat Sheet** --- A quick reference for readers who already know the mechanic. \\
**Mechanics** --- A detailed, objective explanation of this mechanic. \\
**Strategy** --- How to solve this mechanic, using NA PF strategies. \\
**POVs** --- Embedded POV videos of the mechanic.

Depending on how you learn best, the mechanics section can likely be skipped.
If you find that the Strategy section is unclear, you can always revisit the
Mechanics section.
